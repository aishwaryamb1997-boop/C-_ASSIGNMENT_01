# C-_ASSIGNMENT_01
5 Programs part of the 1st Assignment on C# programming.

## Contents
- **Task01** – Write a C# program that asks the user to enter multiple lines of text (until they type "STOP"). Save these lines into a file named "output.txt". Then, read and display the contents of the file. Implement proper exception handling to catch potential errors (e.g., file access issues).
   
- **Task02** – Write a program that takes a list of integers from the user and performs the following operations using LINQ:
a) Find all numbers greater than 50
b) Sort the numbers in ascending order
c) Find the square of each number

- **Task03** – 3.	Create a program that allows the user to store student records using a dictionary. Each student should have:
ID (integer, unique)
Name (string)
Your program should allow the user to:
a) Add a new student.
b) Remove a student by ID.
c) Display all students.

- **Task04** – 4.	Simulate an online order processing system using async programming. Your program should:
a) Ask the user for an order name.
b) Display "Processing order..."
c) Wait 3 seconds (to simulate processing time).
d) Display "Order for [item] is ready!"
Use async and await to make the processing non-blocking.

- **Task05** – 5.	Write a program to write 10MB of data to multiple files as per the procedure mentioned below:
•	Write 10MB of binary data in blocks of 50kB byte array
•	The above should be replicated for 100 files i.e. after execution, the program should have created 100 number 10MB files.
•	After completion of writing to each single file, the program should output the following message on console "<Filename> Writing Completed"
•	Execute the above program in a single thread and also multiple threads/tasks using async/await programming. Make sure that the UI thread is not blocked.
•	Note the time taken for execution of the program in single task and multiple tasks


## Notes
All projects are tested and run successfully on Visual Studio 2022, .NET 8.0.
